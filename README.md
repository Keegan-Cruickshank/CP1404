# Practical 02 - Strings, Files, Exceptions

Working through the fundimental principles behind strings, files and exceptions in Python. Had some fun with this one but only because I misread the instructions.

# Learning Outcome

## Strings with ' or "

I have chosen to prefer the **"** tag when enclosing a string. I simply think it flows better in my case. Im unsure if that thought will persist in the harder scenarios but i would prefer not to have to escape every **"** character within my string everytime.

## Strict vs Javascript

I'm so very used to JS that trying to add an Int And Str just doesn't seem like it should throw an error to me. It took me quite a while to realise my mistake on a machine with a broken inspector. Probably wont happen again now though and am coming around on the syntax within Python.
